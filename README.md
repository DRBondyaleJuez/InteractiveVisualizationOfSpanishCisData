## __DESCRIPTION__
This code was used as a training exercise to practice web developing and the use of [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/es-es). Some selfmade assets are used for the website. It also contains links to the sources of the data.

The graphs in the Tableau section contain displayable tooltips and are dynamically filtered, this means, hovering over parameters displays informations and clicking filters all the figures to provide the data only of the selected data.

The website is in spanish because it worked with spanish socialogical data.

### __DATA:__

![logo_cis](https://github.com/DRBondyaleJuez/InteractiveVisualizationOfSpanishCisData/assets/98281752/45f36728-4c02-4038-90c3-893d7904973e)

The data was obtained from the spanish center for sociological research [(CIS)](https://www.cis.es/detalle-ficha-estudio?origen=estudio&idEstudio=14757). CIS performs monthly surveys to the spanish population regarding sociological and political issues. Precisely , in this case, these are the results of the November 2023 survey. 

The survey contained above 4000 participants from all over Spain.

The survey stores collects some personal information of the person surveyed such as their gender, marital status, religi√≥n, financial situation, education, age ... and also the surveyed opinions and political views regarding current social and polical situations that affect Spain in some capacity. In this case an election had taken place recently that year and the decision of the rrespondents is present in the data.

The survey is anonymous so the identity of the respondents is not present.

__Example of a page of the survey:__

## __USAGE__

The main use of the website is to explore data using Tableau dynamics graphs.

![tableau_logo](https://github.com/DRBondyaleJuez/InteractiveVisualizationOfSpanishCisData/assets/98281752/dac338c8-8a9b-4b63-bc05-9e0ebeac8aad)

The Tableau dashboard is dynamic and interactive. The information in the survey was to large for one single dashboard so it is divided amongst 4 dashboard and the user can navigate between them using the buttons in the top section.

__Example - Links to Sources:__

<div style="text-align: center;">

![responsiveness and links](https://github.com/DRBondyaleJuez/InteractiveVisualizationOfSpanishCisData/assets/98281752/93cdc1d7-8651-4c72-a96e-1a0dcf5950cf)

</div>

The responsiveness of the website is shown and the links at the top that either takes the user to the url source or summary of the data or download a file.

__Example - Dashboard Navigation and Tooltip:__

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Navigation and tooltip display](https://github.com/DRBondyaleJuez/InteractiveVisualizationOfSpanishCisData/assets/98281752/d914d9d7-c435-4955-a9a5-a6d31452f5e0)

</div>

Navigating between the pages of the dashboard and showcasing the display of tooltip when hovering the graph portions. The tooltips usually contains information regarding that parameter, the number of respondents and the % of the total.

__Example - Clicking and filtering the data in current and other dashboards:__

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Clicking filter 1 page](https://github.com/DRBondyaleJuez/InteractiveVisualizationOfSpanishCisData/assets/98281752/99caddf5-77b0-46e8-8601-9a467c537ff9)

</div>

Regions in the map are clicked and the graphs adapt to filter and display only the data for that region. Similarly it works with the portion of the pie chart of gender to show only female respondents or the bubble chart to show only atheist respondents results. These can be combined. The user will need to click it again or click outside to go back to the total respondents. 

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Clicking filter all pages](https://github.com/DRBondyaleJuez/InteractiveVisualizationOfSpanishCisData/assets/98281752/4f28632f-cf59-410a-9507-35fc5ff33a01)

</div>

Here, we explore other dashboards through the navigations and it can be observed that they also adapt to the filtering. Therefore, all dashboards are filtered by the clicking. This allows to observe the respondents of a certain age, of a certain range of earnings, of a certain education ... or that voted for a certain party or that thinks the economy is doing well.
This can be combined.


It must be kept in mind that the number of respondents reduces with every filtration so they can become less representative.
